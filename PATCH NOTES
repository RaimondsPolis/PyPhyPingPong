V1.0.1
    - sandbox mode created
        - similar to endless but with tweakable settings
        - target system is janky but k i n d a works

V1.0.2
    - fixed bug where sides dont make the ball bounce. now the sides also make the ball bounce (for the most part)
        - sometimes wierd stuff happens when ball bounces off the corner
            - sometimes the ball clips into the platform and stays bounces inside untill clips back out again
                - im preety sure its because of the platform rotating and moving during collision
